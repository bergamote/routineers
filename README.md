## Goal

The idea is to simulate the daily humdrum of a small town using html, css and javascript, without using any pre-existing frameworks. Ultimately I'd like to see virtual autonomous agents going about their business, to and from work, picking leisure activities on their days off, etc...

But more than that, the goal is really to learn about coding and to find ways to break big problems into smaller ones that I can actually solve.


## Status

So far I have an actor (jeeper) that can find a straight path to a point (goal) and stops if it encounters an obstacle (wall). All three elements are set at random locations on load. The goal can be set manually by clicking anywhere on the screen.
